## Overview
This folder contains labs analyzing TCP/IP protocols and network behavior.

## Lab 1: TCP Handshake Analysis
- **Source**: TryHackMe - Networking Basics
- **Objective**: Understand the TCP three-way handshake process.
- **Steps**:
  1. Studied the TCP handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
  2. Created a diagram to visualize the process.
  3. Analyzed a sample packet capture using Wireshark.
- **Findings**: Learned how TCP establishes reliable connections.
- **Files**:
  - `lab1_tcp_handshake.png`: Diagram of TCP handshake.
  - `lab1_notes.md`: Analysis notes.
